some grammar notes on topics that I found hard to understand.
### where to place the 's'
- noun + noun
  only if one specifies the other, for example "the car door".
- noun + 's + noun
  only if a person owns something, for example "my brother's bike"
- noun + s' + noun
  only if more than one person owns something, for example "the girls' shoes"

### -y -ly -ily
You can create and adjective from a noun using -y
"I heard a ==squeaky== sound"

You can create an adverb from -ly or -ily
"The girl read ==fluently=="
you use -ily only if the verb ends in -y, otherwise -ly is used.
